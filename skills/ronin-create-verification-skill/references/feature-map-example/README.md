# Notes verification map

This is the source of truth for verifying Notes as a user. Read the index, then run the matching feature recipe.

The example is intentionally strict. It proves actions and stored results, not a final screenshot that happens to look right.

## Baseline preconditions

- Launch Notes at `http://127.0.0.1:4173` with a disposable data directory.
- Set `NOTES_DATA_DIR=/tmp/notes-verify-$RUN_ID` so concurrent runs do not share state.
- Seed notes titled `Quarterly plan` and `Grocery list`.
- Put `control-notes` and the `notes` CLI on `PATH`.
- Run `control-notes doctor`. Require the expected URL, data directory, and build revision.
- Drive only the instance started by this verification run.

## Driving conventions

- Start every recipe from the baseline unless its preconditions say otherwise.
- Prefer ARIA roles and accessible names over CSS selectors or DOM position.
- Treat every command as literal. Keep quoted names and flags unchanged.
- Run browser actions through `control-notes browser`.
- Run terminal actions through `control-notes cli -- <command>`.
- Restore seeded data after a mutation. Keep proof artifacts during cleanup.

## Proof and skip reporting

- Capture the user action and resulting state, not only the final screen.
- UI proof includes an ARIA snapshot and a screenshot with the app identity visible.
- CLI proof includes the command, stdout, stderr, and exit code.
- Mutation proof includes a read-only second view of the stored value.
- Record the feature ID and entry point with every artifact.
- Report an unreachable path with the attempted command and unmet precondition.
- Never report a skipped entry point as verified through a different path.

## Feature entry contract

Each feature file starts with an H1 title and one paragraph describing the user-visible behavior. Then use exactly four H2 sections in this order.

1. `Sub-features` lists short IDs with one line for each behavior.
2. `How to get to it (user POV)` lists every user entry point.
3. `Driving it with <harness>` starts with `Preconditions:` and uses labeled bullets that pair each user action with an exact command and observable result.
4. `Gotchas` lists traps that can waste or invalidate a verification run.

Keep implementation details out of the map. Name user paths, stable handles, required state, commands, and observable proof.

## Features

- [Create a note](./create-note.md) covers browser and CLI creation, cancellation, persistence, and cleanup.
- [Search notes](./search.md) covers toolbar, keyboard, and CLI search with matching, empty, and clear states.
