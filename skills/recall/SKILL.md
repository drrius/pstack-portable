# Recall

**Before you start or resume work, you rebuild the user's recent working context and hand back a tight capsule of where things stand now and what to do next.** Use for "recall my work on X", "catch me up", "what have I been working on", or "where did I leave off".

Keep it tight and on-topic. Read only what the in-scope threads need, then stop. The heavy reading fans out to parallel subagents. The main thread keeps only their findings and the final brief.

Your context lives in two records. Your own chat history holds what you did and decided. The shared record holds everything that happened around the same code under other names: the symptoms users keep reporting, the fixes that shipped and got reverted, the errors still firing in prod. That second record is what the **why** skill searches, across source control, the issue tracker, chat and issue channels, long-form docs, and error tracking. A feature with a long bug tail keeps most of its story there, so don't reconstruct it from your transcripts alone.

Transcript access comes from the active host adapter or an explicit user-provided path constrained to the current workspace or task. Never infer a private transcript location or search a host's home-directory state. If neither source is available, report that chat-history mining is unavailable, use any state capsule the user supplied, and continue with the shared record and live state. Name the missing evidence in the brief.

1. Classify, then route. One specific prior chat to resume is the `session-pickup` playbook, not this. Turning habits into a durable skill is `automate-me`. A human-readable summary of your work is a different task. Recall loads working context across recent chats before you act. If the user already gave you a full state capsule (paths, branch, the change), use it and skip the mining.
2. Lock the scope before searching. Pin the window ("recent" is a real range, default the last 7 days), the topic if named, and the workspace (default the active one; never read another project's transcripts without being asked). State the scope back. Never quietly turn "all" into "recent N".
3. Mine available chat history. Ask the active host adapter for transcripts in the scoped window, or use the explicit in-scope path the user supplied. Order candidates by real modification time rather than identifier, search the topic first, then read only matching conversations and relevant regions; skip the current conversation plus obvious worker, evaluation, and test noise. For a large corpus, define bounded `explore` worker requests and fan them out when delegation is authorized. Each request names its corpus slice, read-only boundary, stop condition, and return schema: topic, the user's goal, decisions, open threads, struggles and corrections, artifacts, and a host-stable conversation citation. If delegation is unavailable, process the slices in the coordinator and disclose that fallback. For one or two conversations, search directly. Keep raw transcripts out of the main context.
4. Sweep the shared record whenever the topic names a feature, file, subsystem, area, or bug. This is the default, not a judgment call, and "my work on X" does not exempt it. A named target carries history you never see in your own transcripts, and that history is the point of the sweep. Hand it to the **why** skill's source investigators, but steer their question from "why was this built this way" to "what's the current state, what's been tried and didn't hold, and what are users still reporting". Reuse its per-source playbooks so you don't reinvent each query vocabulary, run the investigators in parallel with chat-history mining when delegation is available, and inherit its posture: one investigator per source, null results are findings, skip an unavailable connected service and say so. Fold what comes back into the brief. Skip this step only for pure activity recall with no named target ("what did I do this week"), where available chat history and live state are the entire answer.
5. Verify against live state. A transcript or stale ticket is history, not current truth, so take the pull requests, branches, and tickets surfaced by mining and check them with local source control plus the host's connected repository and tracker capabilities. When the answer hinges on what a worker actually did, read the full available transcript rather than a trimmed copy. If the relevant live service is unavailable, label that status unverified instead of presenting history as current truth.
6. Write the brief to the contract below. Group by thread. Stay on the named topic.

## Output contract

Lead with the capsule, then the thread status, then the problems, then the next move. Deeper detail goes below or gets cut.

- **Capsule.** At most 5 bullets. What this work is and where it stands overall.
- **Threads.** One line each, prefixed with exactly one status tag: `[merged #N]`, `[open PR #N]`, `[in flight <branch>]`, `[verified, uncommitted]`, `[reverted #N]`, `[planned, not started]`, or `[history only, live state unavailable]`. A thread with no tag is not done yet, so tag it.
- **Problems.** At most 5, the recurring ones. Include the symptoms users keep reporting and any fix that shipped and was reverted, so the next attempt starts where the last one failed.
- **Next move.** The single most useful next action, concrete.

An adjacent feature or ticket stays out unless it blocks this one. When the capsule and thread lines outgrow a screen, cut detail before you cut threads. Write the brief through the **unslop** skill, cite chat findings using the stable identifier supplied by the host and shared-record findings by their source (pull request, ticket, chat permalink, or error-tracker issue), and sanitize private context before any public output.

**Reply:** the brief, to the contract above.
